SPOTIFY ANALYTICS DASHBOARD 

This Power BI dashboard explores Spotify listening data to uncover patterns in user behavior across time, platform, and device. It tracks listening trends for tracks, artists, and albums from 2013â€“2024, offering year-wise comparisons, weekend vs. weekday splits, and platform preferences. A key focus is on identifying which music users gravitate toward at different times, and how engagement varies with shuffle mode and skips.  

One of the most impactful insights comes from the hour-by-day heatmap, which visualizes when users listen the most, revealing strong evening activity on weekends. The quadrant analysis cross-maps average track time against track frequency, helping segment songs by "short-repeat favorites," "long-form listens," and low-engagement outliers, useful for playlist optimization or artist feedback. These views offer granular behavioral insights often missed in flat reports.  

The dashboard was developed in Power BI Desktop using advanced DAX techniques and modeling features. SWITCH was used for color-coding scatter plots, while dynamic constant lines were added in the quadrant analysis using new parameter slicers for user interactivity. Conditional formatting brought the heatmap to life, highlighting hourly engagement patterns. Dynamic measures were created using aggregation functions like DISTINCTCOUNT, AVERAGE, and SUM to track KPIs such as total plays, unique artists, and average track time. TOPN and PARALLELPERIOD enabled ranking and time comparisons, while specific charts were filtered year- and platform-wise using the edit relationship feature for isolated context. Additionally, WEEKNUM and custom day columns ensured proper day-wise sorting, and drill-through fields provided detailed playback insights in the grid view.
